## Introduction

[Karabiner-Elements][official] is a FOSS remapping utility for macOS. Initially
I used it to remap a Razer mouse to only find that that the on-board memory
would have to be changed via Razer's [Synapses][r-synapses]. Regardless, I'm using Karabiner
now as my primary keybinding tool for macOS.

### Usage

So far the [karabiner.json][kb-json] is set to:

1. Switch Razer's DeathAdder V2 keyboard's `left_option` <> `left_command` to
   match a PC keyboard's layout to Apple's.
2. Configure a [10-key layout][numeric-keypad-mode] while holding the `capslock`.
