[4] READ GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
================================
:Begin: When everyonen is READY!

Good morning/afternoon, everyone.
I'm going to go over a brief introduction off the record so we're all on the
same page, and then I'll jump into the videographer read-in.  As I said before,
my name is David Boyd and I work at the court reporting agency, Steno, that was
hired by ORDERINGFIRM to help faciliate this deposition today.

Please take a moment to silence all phone and computer notifications at this
time.  Please note that this deposition is being recorded in its entirety and
everything you do can be seen and heard by everyone else on the call.  If you
ever require privacy at any time, I remind you to please mute your microphone
or turn off your video.

If you are not one of the primary participants, we ask that you please mute
yourself and turn off your video so that we can keep the audio feed as clear as
possible.

As a reminder, you can set who you'd like to see in which video slot by
clicking on the participants tab and then clicking on the ellipses next to a
participant's name to assign a slot.  We strongly recommend putting the court
reporter in one of your video slots so you can see if they are trying to signal
for you to stop or ask for clarification.

Due to a 4 hour video call limit, we will all have to refresh our screens at
the four hour mark.  I will give everyone a reminder 15 minutes before that
time.  The approximate refresh time will be OPENVIDEOMEET+4 = XX am/pm.

Lastly, to help the court reporter get a clear and accurate record, we ask that
everyone please speak loud enough so that your microphone can pick up your
voice.  Please keep your face in full view of the camera, be cautios of talking
over one another, and be aware if you do move any papers or anything near your
microphone while someone is speaking.  It can cause a disruption in the audio.

Please keep in mind that because this deposition is being taken remotely, the
reporter may have to ask for further clarification.  I will be here the entire
time for any technical difficulties, but if you happen to lose connection and
cannot return to this meeting, I will provide my phone number to you all now.
I ask taht you write this down or have it handy, just in case.  My phone number
is (512)-270-3020.  Once again, my phone number is (512)-270-3020.  Please give
me a call and I will gladly work with you to get you reconnected.

I am going to state the current time for our video
editors which is: hh:mm:ss TIMEZONE

Alright, before we go on the record, does anyone have any questions?
Okay, stand by to go on the record.
